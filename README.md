# INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM USING ML
 The purpose of the project is to build an Intrusion Detection System to detect network intrusions using machine  learning algorithms XG-Boost and LSTM and sampling technique used is SMOTE. The objective is to predict  network attack with better accuracy and to find suitable algorithm to detect intrusions.
